<h1>About Leif</h1>
<p>
Leif was born in 1996 in Kirkland, Washington.  He moved to Champaign, Illinois, with
his family in 1998.  Leif became interested in music at a young age -- he began learning
to play the piano when he was five years old, and soon took up the clarinet, saxophone,
and electric guitar.  In high school, he became interested in video game design and
created several video games, which were posted at the now-defunct website
www.atomicmindgames.com.  After taking a gap year to record an album of original songs,
Leif started at Tufts University in Fall 2014.
